# BrainTree for Xamarin.Android

A Xamarin.Android binding library for [BrainTree DropIn Android](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.braintreepayments.api/drop-in) library.

> The library used to be under the name of `Naxam.BraintreeDropIn.Droid`. Naxam is no longer in business for years hence I remove the trademark from the name and hope it more neutral for the community to contribute.

## Installation

```
Install-Package BraintreePayments.API.DropIn.Droid
```

## Usage

This project is to provide C# libraries for corresponding libraries in Java/Kotlin, however, the APIs are exactly the same.

Plz follow official guide from Braintree [here](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/start/hello-client).
